  - Espresso
  - Macchiato
  - Cappuccino
- Vodka

  - Soplica

# 1.2 Formula

Here you can define formula

$$ y = \beta_0 + \beta_1X + \epsilon $$
the formula can be reported in the text: $\mu = 1/n \sum X_i$

# 2. Data Analysis
To add R code in the Notebook we need to use the **Chunk**.

```{r}
X <- iris
```

It is possible to have an overview of the data by using the *summary* function.

```{r}
summary(X)
```
In R there are three main type of data:

- **Matrix**. Mathematical Object.
- **Data Frame**. It is devoted to organize and analyze data and it is a generalization of the Matrix.
- **List**. It is an object that can include Data Frames, Matrices or other lists.
